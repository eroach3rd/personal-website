          I’m a Product Management enthusiast, a proud father of an infant, and passionate about workforce development, education advocacy, and creating opportunities for underrepresented communities. My interests include nurturing plants, hip-hop music festivals, and cheering on the Mets and Knicks. Through my career, I’ve cultivated a deep understanding of how to connect people to opportunities, whether through mentorship, education, or innovative products.
